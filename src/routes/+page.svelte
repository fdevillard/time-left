	<section>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>
			The purpose of this website is to help you reflect on the most precious resource we all have:
			<strong>time with our loved ones</strong>. By estimating the average remaining time you might
			have with your relatives, the site offers a perspective that can help you
			<strong>set your priorities right</strong> and focus on meaningful connections.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
		<p>
			It's easy to take the time we have for granted. By understanding what little time we may have
			left with family and friends, we can make intentional choices to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Spend more quality time together.</li>
			<li>Strengthen our relationships.</li>
			<li>Create lasting memories.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Tell Us about You</h2>
		<label for="birthdate">Birthdate:</label>
		<input
			name="birthdate"
			type="date"
			max={DateTime.now().toISO()}
			value={birthDateIso}
			onchange={(event) => {
				try {
					s.birthDate = DateTime.fromISO((event.target as HTMLInputElement)?.value);
				} catch (e) {
					console.info('Invalid date', e);
					s.birthDate = null;
				}
			}}
		/>

		<h2>Life Events</h2>
		<p>
			To make the results more meaningful, think about events that impacted how often you see your
			relatives: when you moved out of your parent's place, met someone special, ended a
			relationship, lived abroad, started a new job, or had children.
		</p>
		<p>
			These turning points influence the time spent with loved ones and help provide a clearer
			picture of your shared time.
