		<p>
			The purpose of this website is to help you reflect on the most precious resource we all have:

			have with your relatives, the site offers a perspective that can help you
			<strong>set your priorities right</strong> and focus on meaningful connections.

		<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
		<p>
			It's easy to take the time we have for granted. By understanding what little time we may have
			left with family and friends, we can make intentional choices to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Spend more quality time together.</li>
			<li>Strengthen our relationships.</li>
			<li>Create lasting memories.</li>
		</ul>
